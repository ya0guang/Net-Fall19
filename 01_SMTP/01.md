## Two Questions

- What happens when you try to send to a non-IU email address? Why?

When I set a Gmail address as the RCPT, the server returns an error:

```shell
550 5.7.1 aaa@gmail.com... Relaying denied. Proper authentication required.
```

It seems that the relay server needs authentication to mail to a non-IU domain email address. 

I guess it's mainly because the security policy disallows people from IU to abuse the mail system to send junk mails without authentication. I've heard that when classifying emails, the domain address (after @) is an important criterion. For not being classified as a malicious domain, the relay server set up this policy.

- What happens when you use a made-up from address? Why?

I can set anything I want to "MAIL FROM". If the domain of the email really exists, I will send this email successfully, but got an error message if it doesn't exist.

For example, when it doesn't exists:
```shell
HELO mail-relay.iu.edu
250 mail-relay.iu.edu Hello 149-160-229-246.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu [149.160.229.246], pleased to meet you
MAIL FROM: oiadsabd@AIUDbai.com
250 2.1.0 oiadsabd@AIUDbai.com... Sender ok
RCPT TO: iuasdb@iu.edu
553 5.1.8 iuasdb@iu.edu... Domain of sender address oiadsabd@AIUDbai.com does not exist
```

But if the domain really exists...
```shell

Escape character is '^]'.

```
Then I can do something really bad :)

I think it's because the system admin assumes that everyone in IU is benign, or they can always find out the computer which is sending malicious emails on campus(maybe by tracing IP or MAC address). Since the server cannot be accessed directly outside from IU, people using the mail system must be an IU student, faculty or employee. However, to be honest, the server has vulnerabilities here: it only verifies the existence of the domain of sender, but allows any other email from real domains to be set and sent.
