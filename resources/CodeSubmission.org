** Overview

This class will make use of the Github service provided by IU.

 * https://github.iu.edu
 * Login with your IU username and password.

Do not confuse this with github.com!

** Setting up your private keys

To work efficiently with IU github, you will need to set up your private
keys. Github.com has a very good tutorial on how to set this up. You should note
that where the tutorial refers to *github.com*, you should use *github.iu.edu*.

[[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/][generating ssh keys]]

** Repository Creation

You should create a *PRIVATE* repository called *Net-Fall18* on IU Github. 

Make sure to set your new repositories to "Private" as shown in Figure
[[fig:create_repo]] to prevent others from viewing your work!

*IMPORTANT*: Add the =sicenet= user to your *Net-Fall18* repository.

 * The Github =sicenet= user is the instructor and AI account for this class.
   You must ensure that this user is added as a collaborator to the repository
   you will submit for grading.  You will be able to add collaborators under the
   "Settings" for your repository.  See Figure [[fig:add_collab_repo]] below.

** Course Repository Duplication

The course repository should be duplicated using the steps below:

 * Change directories to a scratch area. Create a bare clone of the *Net-Fall18*
   course repository using:

#+begin_src text
git clone --bare git@github.iu.edu:SICE-Networks/Net-Fall18
#+end_src

 * Enter the Net-Fall18 directory

#+begin_src text
cd Net-Fall18
#+end_src

 * Push this repo data to your repository replacing /yourreponame/ with the
   appropriate =git@github.iu.edu= address.

#+begin_src text
git push --mirror yourreponame
#+end_src text

 * If all went well and your shared repository has the data, you can remove the
   directory because it is no longer needed.

#+begin_src text
cd ..
rm -rf Net-Fall18
#+end_src

** Remote Setup

You will need to keep the original course repository as an upstream remote for
your repository. This repository will be updated periodically with new lab
material. Adding an upstream remote will allow you to keep your copy
synchronized with updated lab material.

 * Clone your *Net-Fall18*

 * cd into the Net-Fall18 directory. Add an upstream remote to your
   repository. 

#+begin_src text
git remote add upstream git@github.iu.edu:SICE-Networks/Net-Fall18.git
#+end_src

 * In the future, you can pull in updates to the course repository using a fetch
   command:

#+begin_src text
git fetch upstream
#+end_src

** Submission with Canvas

Each assignment and project for this class will have a corresponding assignment
created in Canvas.  Once you are ready to submit your assignment or project for
grading, select URL type in the Canvas submit options and paste a url to the
specific commit hash of your code repository.

 * As an example, your submitted URL should have a format similar to:

#+begin_src text
https://github.iu.edu/ezkissel/Net-Fall18/commit/1cde9d43e12b8a2e7371b33372b14a5e9a1f0d9c
#+end_src
