* Instructions

In this assigmnent you will gain experience with using *nix networking commands
to control layer 3 (IP) routing and a basic network address translation (NAT)
configuration.  The assignment relies on nodes you can provision on GENI racks,
so spend some initial setup time becoming comfortable allocating the topology
below and with accessing the nodes using SSH.

 * Configure an experiment on GENI that looks like the topology above.

 * If you do not want to start from scratch, drag-and-drop, and rename nodes,
   you can start with this provided [[file:scripts/a5_request_rspec.xml][request Rspec]].

 * Each site should be assigned a different GENI Aggregate so you have some
   geographic diversity and observable differences in latency.

 * Use naming that makes it easy to refer to resources, e.g. distinguish between
   router and client nodes for each site.

 * Make sure to select link type _*EGRE Tunnel*_ for all three links
   connecting your routers.  Other stitching remains fraught with
   danger in GENI.
 
** Experiment IP Configuration

This next step involves assigning IP addresses to each of your nodes.  The
default IP addresses assigned by the GENI Control Framework will not work for
this assignment so you will need to perform this assignment using the =ifconfig=
or =ip= commands.  A "cheat sheet" for using the =ip= tool is provided [[file:images/rh_ip_cheatsheet.pdf][here]].
These are a valuable set of commands to know for any network adminstrator or
network hobbyist alike.

Instead of the IP addresses assignmed by the GENI CF, we will assign IP subnets
for resources at each site, and for each router link.  Below is the recommended
assignmnet:

| Site or link | IP subnet      |
|--------------+----------------|
| Site 1       | 10.10.0.0/24   |
| Site 2       | 10.10.1.0/24   |
| Site 3       | 192.168.0.0/24 |
| rtr1-rtr3    | 10.10.100.0/30 |
| rtr1-rtr2    | 10.10.101.0/30 |
| rtr2-rtr3    | 10.10.102.0/30 |

Here are the general rules about the IPs in your network:

   * Nodes using the _10.10.0.0/16_ range should be considered publically
     routable in this testbed.  These are still within what is known as RFC1918
     "private" address space but for the purposes of your experiment these will
     be treated as your "public Internet" addresses.

   * We will consider Site 3 hosts using _192.168.0.0/24_ addresses to be behind
     a home router (=router3=) using NAT and will experiment with this setup in
     Task 3.  This is your "private" network.

   * For this assignmnet only choose one of the nodes behind each router to test
     with at each site.  For example, configure =node1-1= and leave =node1-2=
     unassigned.  We will save the second node for the next assignment.

There are three approaches to take when it comes to configuring your GENI
resources:

   1. Update the Request Rspec (directly or via the web interface) to
      pre-configure the IP addresses you'd like for each node.  This option is
      difficult to iterate on and update later.

   2. Write a script that configures IP and route settings after the nodes are
      accessible using SSH.  A template with some example assignments is
      provided in [[file:scripts/l3_setup.sh][scripts/l3_setup.sh]] This approach is recommended and makes it
      easy to repeatably reconfigure all resources when needed.

   3. Manually login to each node and execute the commands.  This works but is
      time consuming and error prone as the testbed changes.

Once your IP addresses are set, it's time to experiment with how traffic can
flow in your topology.  Login to =router1= and make sure you can ping =router2=
and =router3=.  The "core" of your network should be working.

However, now try to login to =node1-1= and ping =node2-1=, or even =router2=.
What happens and why?  Hint: inspect the Linux routing table on each node.

=ip route show=

or using the deprecated command:

=route -n=

** Task 1: Add static routes

This first task will have you create both network and host routes so that you
can achieve full connectivity between all nodes at Site 1 and Site 2.  Recall
that Site 3 has a "private" address space that you will deal with later, but
=router3= should still be reachable from all Site 1 and Site 2 nodes on its
"core" IP addresses.

For each client node behind a router you will need to add a route for the
_10.10.0.0/16_ "public" network and use that site's router node as the
"gateway".  As an example of how to do this:

=ip route add 10.10.0.0/16 via 10.10.0.1=

assuming this site's router has an address of _10.10.0.1_ for the given node
link.  This essentially says /send all traffic for any destinations in the
10.10.0.0/16 range to the router interface 10.10.0.1/ and let the router handle
it for me.  At Site 3, the client nodes will additionally need a similar gateway
set to =router3= for the _192.168.0.0/24_ subnet.

*Note*: the routing table for each node in your topology also contains a
/default/ route in the _172.16.0.0/12_ network.  This is for the management
network allowing you to SSH into the nodes in the first place.  Do not disrupt
this default route or you will lose access to your node and will need to reboot
or recreate them!  As long as you make route changes in _10.10.0.0/16_ you
should be safe.

With this public network route in place on each client, you should be able to
ping any other router node from any client.  But, can a client in Site 1 reach a
client in Site 2?  Why not?  Hint: inspect the routing table of the "core"
router nodes!

The next step involves adding network routes so each Site's router knows how to
route to each other's networks.  You should now create these routes and using
the shortest path between each site, which are hopefully obvious in this simple
topology.  For these "core" network routes, you will also be using the
"gateway"/"via" directive when setting up these routes.  This is functionally
setting the "next-hop" for the traffic to take in the network for a given
address prefix.  Remember your CIDR notation.

Once you have both the client and "core" routes set you should have full
connectivity between all router nodes and all "client" nodes in Sites 1 and 2.
Test this out and verify that all works as expected before moving on to the next
task.  Note the latencies you see when pinging between each site.

** Task 2: Update routes

For this task you will write a script that makes Site 1 traffic route through
Site 3 to get to Site 2: the long path!  This is accomplished by simply removing
the old routes for the specific prefixes and installing new routes across the
necessary "core" routers that will handle the traffic.

   * Test the route update by pinging hosts in Site 2 and observing the latency
     change.  The ping RTT values should increase significantly depending on
     which aggregates you have selected for your experiment topology.

   * Make sure your approach can switch easily either routing mode.  Inspect the
     routing tables on each router node to verify the necessary routes are in
     place for each direction of traffic.

   * Incorporate this route change functionality into your main configuration
     script or submit it as a standalone script that updates the necessary
     "core" routes as appropriate.

** Task 3: Configure NAT for /netster/ services

In this final task you will explore the "private" subnet at Site 3 in the
_192.168.0.0/24_ address space.  Imagine that =router3= is your home router, the
device terminating your ISP's connection.  In a typical home router setup
=router3= would be handing out addresses to your devices in the private address
space you have assigned.  For this experiment, we have a single =node3-1= that
already has an address but at the moment can't reach the rest of the "Internet",
nor can any other host reach services that may be running on that node.

The first step is to allow reachability for Site 3 nodes behind =router3=.  To
accomplish this we need to enable some form of NAT so that =router3= can
translate the traffic from the "private" subnet and make it routable within the
"public" network already configured.  Conversely, =router3= needs to translate
return traffic from the "public" side back to the "private" space node that
initiated the outgoing traffic.  With NAT, think about how =router3= "knows" to
send return traffic from the public Internet back to the correct host in the
private address space.  What is necessary to make this possible?

You will use a tool on Linux called =iptables= to accomplish the NAT
configuration.  For a good tutorial on iptables and NAT see [[https://www.karlrupp.net/en/computer/nat_tutorial][this resource.]]
There are also many other online resources and tutorials on iptables and NAT.
Read up on tables, chains, and targets and how they apply in the NAT use cases.

The primary technique is to use the =-t nat= table and make use of the
POSTROUTING chain and MASQUERADE target.  For example,

=iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s <IP subnet> -o <eth dev> -j MASQUERADE=

Experiment with iptables and the NAT table until you have a functional NAT
=router3= configuration.  From =node3-1= you should be able to reach the client
nodes in Sites 1 and 2.  Note that you may need to specialize your NAT
configuration since there are two possible egress paths from =router3= to reach
Site 1 or Site 2 depending on the already installed "core" routes.

The final step is to use /netster/ as the service we'd like to expose to the
world on one of Site 3's client nodes through =router3=.  Make sure you can copy
a working /netster/ compiled binary or Python program that runs on the client
node in Site 3.

   * Pick a port for /netster/ to run in server mode.  This is the port we need
     to expose using iptables.

   * Make sure the NAT configuration outlined above allows hosts in Site 3 to
     reach the "outside" world.

Now, read the tutorial section linked above about *Applications* and understand
how to use iptables to redirect a port on =router3= to the client node where you
are running your /netster/ service.  This is a technique known as Destination
NAT (DNAT).  The iptables rules should look similar to:

=iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <router3 port> -j DNAT --to-destination <client:port>=

Now if you try to access the =router3= port you used in the DNAT rule, your
remote client should establish contact with the /netster/ service running on the
Site 3 client in the "private" subnet.  Make sure you inspect the installed
iptables rules with

=iptables -t nat -L=

If you have ever setup ports on your home router for a given application running
on your desktop or laptop, this is exactly what that "port forwarding" feature
does!  You are allowing port-specific access to a service within your private
network through the router with a public-facing interface.

To gain a deeper understanding of what the traffic looks like at each hop in
your testbed, you can run =tcpdump= as root on any of the node interfaces.
Using =tcpdump= can also be a valuable debugging tool as you try and figure out
how traffic is being forwarded and rewritten as you explore the configurations
in this assignment.  A typical usage looks like:

=tcpdump -i eth1 -n=

This will display all the packets moving in and out of interface =eth1=.  For
those not familiar, =tcpdump= is like Wireshark on the command line.  You can
actually capture the packet traces to a file using =tcpdump= and open them with
Wireshark if desired.

** Plan for Assignment 06
   
   * You will use the same testbed and the additional node at each site so make
     sure you extend and keep your experiment alive and running.

   * Think about how much effort and planning is necessary to update routes
     statically even for a relative small topology.  There is a reason why
     routing algorithms exist!  We will explore how to apply dynamic forwarding
     rules in the next assignment.

** TO SUBMIT
   * Running GENI experiment that has been extended so it does not expire before
     the end of the semester.
   * Scripts that configure your experiment for Tasks 1-3 with instructions on
     to apply them and test each correctness of each Task.
   * Write a report in pdf to show all your work including any necessary snapshot
